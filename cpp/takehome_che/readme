Overview:
This repo includes two sets of tools. The first one can be used for json string serialization and deserialization; the second one is to convert chrono time point to and from string.


Usage:
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make -j
./test/xjsonTest
./test/xtimeTest
./benchmark/jsonRDWRBenchmark
./src/timerEvent


Explanation:
The json util is implemented in xjson.h and xjson.cpp. One needs to derive a data structure from a class JsonObj, and fill two members mem2fromStr_ and mem2toStr_ in the constructor. Then the two functions str2obj and obj2str can be used to convert the data structure from and to a json string. An exmaple can be found in test/xjsonTest.cpp
The time util has two main functions str2tp and tp2str to convert time point from and to string. Examples can be found in test/xtimeTest.cpp.
In addition, Timer and Scheduler classes are implemented to create time events. An example can be found in src/timeEvent.cpp


Limitations:
json util assumes the input json string is valid, and doesn't have error check. Furthermore, it can only parse json strings without nested object. 
The time util doesn't support time zone, and has the time resolution fixed to microseconds.


Test:
A few test cases are provided in test folder using gtest


Benchmark:
The json util is compared to rapidjson library using google benchmark. The json util is about 2 times slower than rapidjson for reading json string, and about 20% slower for writing to json string. The bottleneck is probably the string manipulation, and string convertion to arithmetic types.
